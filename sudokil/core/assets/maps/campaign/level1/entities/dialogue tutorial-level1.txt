"Hello, and welcome to your first robot scripting class."

"Go ahead and open the terminal window."

"OK, now before we begin let’s get the camera turned on.”

"Type 'ls' in the terminal to list the files and directories in your current folder."

“There is a folder called camera. Type 'cd camera' to change into that directory.”

"Now if you type 'ls' again, you will see all the files inside the camera directory."

"We want to run the script called start.sh, so go ahead and type 'start.sh'."

"Fantastic. We now have the map loaded up."

"Move the camera by left clicking and dragging the map, or using the arrow keys."

"Zoom with the mouse wheel, or the +/- keys."

"Great, now back to the terminal window."

"Type 'cd ..' in the terminal window to return to the parent directory of the current directory, which is where we started."

"I've copied the files for robot1 into your directory, so if you 'ls' again, you should see it."

"As we did with the camera, type 'cd robot1' to move into the robot1 directory."

"If you 'ls' in this directory, you should see a script called 'forward.sh'."

"Perfect. Now run 'forward.sh' again to get the robot to the end. If you press the up arrow, it will paste your previous command."
